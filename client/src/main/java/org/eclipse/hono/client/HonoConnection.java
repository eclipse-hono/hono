/**
 * A wrapper around a single AMQP 1.0 connection and a single session to a Hono service endpoint.
 * <p>
 * The session is shared by all AMQP 1.0 links established for <em>sender</em> and <em>receiver</em>
 * links created using the corresponding factory methods.
 * <p>
 * Before any links can be created, the underlying AMQP connection needs to be established. This is done by
 * invoking one of the <em>connect</em> methods.
 * <p>
 * This class represents the <em>client</em> side when establishing the AMQP connection:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The client tries to establish a TCP/TLS connection to the peer. For this to succeed, the peer must have registered a
 * socket listener on the IP address and port that the client is configured to use.</li>
 * <li>The client initiates a SASL handshake if requested by the peer. The client needs to be
 * configured with correct credentials in order for this stage to succeed.</li>
 * <li>Finally, the client and the peer need to agree on AMQP 1.0 specific connection parameters like capabilities
 * and session window size.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Some of the <em>connect</em> methods accept a {@code ProtonClientOptions} type parameter. Note that these options
 * only influence the client's behavior when establishing the TCP/TLS connection with the peer. The overall behavior of
 * the client regarding the establishment of the AMQP connection must be configured using the
 * {@link ClientConfigProperties} passed in to the {@link #newConnection(Vertx, ClientConfigProperties)} method.
 * In particular, the {@link ClientConfigProperties#setReconnectAttempts(int)} method can be used to specify,
 * how many times the client should try to establish a connection to the peer before giving up.
 * <p>
 * <em>NB</em> When the client tries to establish a connection to the peer, it stores the <em>current</em>
 * vert.x {@code Context} in a local variable and performs all further interactions with the peer running
 * on this Context. Invoking any of the connection's methods from a vert.x Context other than the one
 * used for establishing the connection may cause race conditions or even deadlocks, because the handlers
 * registered on the {@code Future}s returned by these methods will be invoked from the stored Context.
 * It is the invoking code's responsibility to either ensure that the connection's methods are always invoked
 * from the same Context or to make sure that the handlers are running on the correct Context, e.g. by using
 * the {@link #executeOrRunOnContext(Handler)} method.
