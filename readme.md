[Eclipse Hono](https://www.eclipse.org/hono) provides uniform (remote) service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a (cloud) back end. It specifically supports scalable and secure data ingestion (*telemetry* data) as well as *command & control* type message exchange patterns and provides interfaces for provisioning & managing device identity and access control rules.
