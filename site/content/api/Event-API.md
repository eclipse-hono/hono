The *Event* API is used by *Devices* to send event messages downstream.
*Business Applications* and other consumers use the API to receive messages published by devices belonging to a particular tenant.
<!--more-->

The Event API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to Hono using AMQP 1.0 in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections. Throughout the remainder of this page we will simply use *AMQP* when referring to AMQP 1.0.

The *Event* API is identical to the [*Telemetry* API]({{< relref "Telemetry-API.md" >}}) regarding the provided operations, the message format and the message flow. 
However it provides a different quality of service for messages sent to the *Event* endpoint by routing them via a persistent message broker to guarantee *AT LEAST ONCE* delivery.

# Southbound Operations

The following operations can be used by *Devices* and/or *Protocol Adapters* (to which the devices are connected) to publish event messages for consumption by downstream consumers like *Business Applications*.

Both *Devices* as well as *Protocol Adapters* will be referred to as *clients* in the remainder of this section.

## Send Event

**Preconditions**

1. Client has established an AMQP connection with Hono's Event endpoint.
1. Client has established an AMQP link in role *sender* with Hono using target address `event/${tenant_id}` where `${tenant_id}` is the ID of the tenant that the client wants to upload event messages for. 
1. The device for which the client wants to send an event has been registered (see [Device Registration API]({{< relref "Device-Registration-API.md" >}})).
1. Client has obtained a *registration assertion* for the device from the Device Registration service by means of the [assert Device Registration operation]({{< relref "Device-Registration-API.md#assert-device-registration" >}}).

Hono supports *AT LEAST ONCE* delivery of *Event* messages only. A client therefore MUST use `unsettled` for the *snd-settle-mode* and `first` for the *rcv-settle-mode* fields of its *attach* frame during link establishment. All other combinations are not supported by Hono and result in the termination of the link.

**Message Flow**

TBD

**Message Format**

See [Telemetry API]({{< relref "Telemetry-API.md#upload-telemetry-data" >}}) for definition of message format.

Note that Hono does not return any *application layer* message back to the client in order to signal the outcome of the operation. Instead, Hono signals reception of the message by means of the AMQP `ACCEPTED` outcome if the message complies with the formal requirements and the downstream AMQP 1.0 messaging network has also *accepted* the event. Note that it depends on the configuration of the messaging network what *accepted* actually means. By default, event messages are marked as *durable* and the messaging network will thus at least have persisted the event successfully when it signals the `ACCEPTED` outcome to Hono.

Whenever a client sends an event that cannot be processed because it does not conform to the message format defined above, Hono settles the message transfer using the AMQP `REJECTED` outcome containing an `amqp:decode-error`. Clients **should not** try to re-send such rejected messages unaltered.

If the event passes formal verification, the outcome signaled to the client is the one received from the downstream AMQP 1.0 messaging network. In this case, clients may try to re-send messages for which a delivery state other than `ACCEPTED` has been returned.

# Northbound Operations

## Receive Events

Hono delivers messages containing event messages reported by a particular device in the same order that they have been received in (using the *Events* operation defined above).
Hono supports multiple non-competing *Business Application* consumers of event messages for a given tenant. Hono allows each *Business Application* to have multiple competing consumers for event messages for a given tenant to share the load of processing the messages.

**Preconditions**

1. Client has established an AMQP connection with Hono.
2. Client has established an AMQP link in role *receiver* with Hono using source address `event/${tenant_id}` where `${tenant_id}` represents the ID of the tenant the client wants to retrieve event messages for.

Hono supports *AT LEAST ONCE* delivery of *Event* messages only. A client therefore MUST use `unsettled` for the *snd-settle-mode* and `first` for the *rcv-settle-mode* fields of its *attach* frame during link establishment. All other combinations are not supported by Hono and result in the termination of the link.

**Message Flow**

TBD

**Message Format**

See [*Telemetry API*]({{< relref "Telemetry-API.md" >}}) for definition of message format.
