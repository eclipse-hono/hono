The *Command and Control* API is used by *Business Applications* to send commands to devices connected to Hono. Command messages can be used to
execute operations on devices, e.g. updating a configuration property, installing a software component or activating an actuator.

This API has been added in Hono 0.6. Previous versions do not support nor implement the Command & Control API.

The Command & Control API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to Hono using AMQP 1.0 in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections. Throughout the remainder of this page we will simply use AMQP when referring to AMQP 1.0.

# Operations

The following API defines operations that can be used by *Business Applications* to send commands to devices over an AMQP 1.0 Network and get a response in return.

## Send a Command

### Preconditions

1. *Business Application* has established an AMQP connection with the AMQP 1.0 Network.  
2. *Business Application* has established an AMQP link in role *sender* with the target address `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}`. Where `${device_id}` is the ID of the device to send messages to and `${tenant_id}` is the ID of the tenant that the device belongs to.
3. *Business Application* has established an AMQP link in role *receiver* with the source address `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}/${reply-to}`. Where `${reply-to}` may be any arbitrary string chosen by the client. This link is used by the client to receive the response of the executed command. This linkâ€™s source address is also referred to as the reply-to address for the request messages.

**Link establishment and Message Flow**

The following sequence diagram shows the whole message exchange including the response being sent back to the Business Application.

**Message Format**

The following table provides an overview of the properties the *Business Application* needs to set on a command message.

| Name | Mandatory | Location | Type      | Description |
| :--- | :-------: | :------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| *subject*        | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | MUST contain the command name to be executed by a device. |
| *correlation-id* | no        | *properties*             | *message-id* | MAY contain an ID used to correlate a response message to the original request. If set, it is used as the *correlation-id* property in the response, otherwise the value of the *message-id* property is used. |
| *message-id*     | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | MUST contain an identifier that uniquely identifies the message at the sender side. |
| *reply-to*       | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | MUST contain the source address that the client wants to receive response messages from. This address MUST be the same as the source address used for establishing the client's receive link (see [Preconditions]({{< relref "#preconditions" >}})). |

A command message MAY contain arbitrary payload to be sent to the device in an AMQP Data section. The value of the command message's *subject* value may provide a hint to the device regarding the format, encoding and semantics of the payload data.

## Receiving the Command's execution result

After execution of a command on a device, the device MUST send a response message indicating the outcome of executing the command.

**Message Format**

The following table provides an overview of the properties set on a Command's response message.

| Name | Mandatory | Location | Type | Description |
| :--- | :-------: | :------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| *correlation-id* | yes | *properties* | *message-id* | MUST contain the correlation ID used to match the command message with the response message containing the result of execution on the device. |
| *status* | yes | *application-properties* | *integer* | MUST indicate the status of the execution. See table below for possible values. |

The status property must contain a valid HTTP status code: <a name="status"></a>

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| *2xx* | Indicating success; the codes are dependent on the adapter and device, which handles the command. |
| *4xx* | Indicating failure; the codes are dependent on the adapter and device, which handles the command. |
| *503* | The command cannot be sent to the target device. |

For status codes indicating an error (codes in the `400 - 499` range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred.

If a command message response contains a payload, the body of the message MUST consist of a single AMQP *Data* section containing the response message data.
