The *Command & Control* API of Eclipse Hono&trade; is used by *Business Applications* to send commands to connected devices.

Commands can be used to trigger actions on devices. Examples include updating a configuration property, installing a software component or switching the state of an actuator.
<!--more-->

Hono distinguishes two types of commands. The first type is *one-way* only. In this case the sender of the command does not expect the device to send back a message in response to the command. This type of command is referred to as a *one-way command* in the remainder of this page. One-way commands may be used to e.g. *notify* a device about a change of state.

The second type of commands expects a *response* to be sent back from the device as a result of processing the command. In this case the response contains a *status* code which indicates whether the command could be processed successfully. If so, the response may also include data representing the result of processing the command. This type of command is plainly referred to as a *command* because it represents the default case.

The Command & Control API is defined by means of AMQP 1.0 message exchanges, i.e. a client needs to connect to Hono using AMQP 1.0 in order to invoke operations of the API as described in the following sections. Throughout the remainder of this page we will simply use AMQP when referring to AMQP 1.0.

There is also a description of Command & Control [at the conceptual level]({{< ref "/concepts/command-and-control.md" >}}) 
and the [Getting Started]({{< ref "/getting-started.md" >}}) guide contains a walk through example.

{{% note %}}
The Command & Control API has been added in Hono 0.6. Prior versions do neither support nor implement it. One-way commands have been added in Hono 0.8.

# Operations

The following API defines operations that can be used by *Business Applications* to send commands to devices over an AMQP 1.0 Network.

## Send a One-Way Command

Business Applications use this operation to send a command to a device for which they do not expect to receive a response from the device.

**Preconditions**

1. The *Business Application* has established an AMQP connection with the AMQP 1.0 Network.
2. The *Business Application* has established an AMQP link in role *sender* with the target address `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}`, where `${device_id}` is the ID of the device to send messages to and `${tenant_id}` is the ID of the tenant that the device belongs to.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the establishment of the required link:

![Send One-Way Command Preconditions](../command_control_send_preconditions.png)

**Message Format**

The following table provides an overview of the properties the *Business Application* needs to set on a one-way command message.

| Name             | Mandatory | Location                 | Type         | Description |
| :--------------- | :-------: | :----------------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| *subject*        | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | The name of the command to be executed by the device. |
| *content-type*   | no        | *properties*             | *string*     | If present, MUST contain a *Media Type* as defined by [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046) which describes the semantics and format of the command's input data contained in the message payload. However, not all protocol adapters will support this property as not all transport protocols provide means to convey this information, e.g. MQTT 3.1.1 has no notion of message headers. |
| *message-id*     | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | An identifier that uniquely identifies the message at the sender side. |

The command message MAY contain arbitrary payload to be sent to the device in a single AMQP *Data* section. The value of the message's *subject* property may provide a hint to the device regarding the format, encoding and semantics of the payload data.

Hono indicates the outcome of the operation by means of the following AMQP delivery states:

| Delivery State | Description                                      |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `accepted`    | The command has been delivered to the device for processing. |
| `released`    | The command has not been delivered to the device because the device is (currently) not connected. |
| `rejected`    | The command has not been delivered to the device because it does not contain all required information. |

**Note** that Hono relies on the particular protocol adapter to deliver commands to devices. Depending on the used transport protocol and the adapter's implementation, the `accepted` outcome may thus indicate any of the following:

- An *attempt* has been made to deliver the command to the device. However, it is unclear if the device has received (or processed) the command.
- The device has acknowledged the reception of the command but has not processed the command yet.
- The device has received and processed the command.

**Examples**

The following sequence diagram shows the successful delivery of a command to a device:

![Successfully send a One-Way Command](../command_control_one_way_success.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the delivery of a command fails because the device is not connected:

![Device not connected](../command_control_device_not_connected.png)

The following sequence diagram illustrates how a malformed command sent by a *Business Application* gets rejected:

## Send a (Request/Response) Command

*Business Applications* use this operation to send a command to a device for which they expect the device to send back a response.


**Preconditions**

<a name="receiver-link-precondition"></a>

1. The *Business Application* has established an AMQP connection with the AMQP 1.0 Network.
2. The *Business Application* has established an AMQP link in role *sender* with the target address `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}`, where `${device_id}` is the ID of the device to send messages to and `${tenant_id}` is the ID of the tenant that the device belongs to.
3. The *Business Application* has established an AMQP link in role *receiver* with the source address `control/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}`.
This link is used by the *Business Application* to receive the response to the command from the device. This linkâ€™s source address is also used as the `reply-to` address for the request messages. The `${reply_id}` may be any [arbitrary string]({{< relref "#strategies-for-building-the-receiver-link-address" >}}) chosen by the application.

**Link establishment**

The following sequence diagram illustrates the establishment of the required sender link:

![Send Command Preconditions](../command_control_send_preconditions.png)

The following sequence diagram illustrates the establishment of the required receiver link:

![Receive Response Preconditions](../command_control_receive_preconditions.png)

**Command Message Format**

The following table provides an overview of the properties the *Business Application* needs to set on a command message.

| Name             | Mandatory | Location                 | Type         | Description |
| :--------------- | :-------: | :----------------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| *subject*        | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | MUST contain the command name to be executed by a device. |
| *content-type*   | no        | *properties*             | *string*     | If present, MUST contain a *Media Type* as defined by [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046) which describes the semantics and format of the command's input data contained in the message payload. However, not all protocol adapters will support this property as not all transport protocols provide means to convey this information, e.g. MQTT 3.1.1 has no notion of message headers. |
| *correlation-id* | no        | *properties*             | *message-id* | If present, MUST contain an ID used to correlate a response message to the original request. If set, it is used as the *correlation-id* property in the response, otherwise the value of the *message-id* property is used. |
| *message-id*     | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | MUST contain an identifier that uniquely identifies the message at the sender side. |
| *reply-to*       | yes       | *properties*             | *string*     | MUST contain the source address that the application wants to receive the response from. This address MUST be the same as the source address used for establishing the client's receiver link (see [Preconditions]({{< relref "#receiver-link-precondition" >}}) above). |

The command message MAY contain arbitrary payload to be sent to the device in a single AMQP *Data* section. The value of the command message's *subject* value may provide a hint to the device regarding the format, encoding and semantics of the payload data.

Hono uses following AMQP delivery states to indicate the outcome of sending the command to the device:

| Delivery State | Description                                      |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `accepted`    | The command has been delivered to the device for processing. |
| `released`    | The command has not been delivered to the device because the device is (currently) not connected. |
| `rejected`    | The command has not been delivered to the device because it does not contain all required information. |

**Note** that Hono relies on the particular protocol adapter to deliver commands to devices. Depending on the used transport protocol and the adapter's implementation, the `accepted` outcome may thus indicate any of the following:

- An *attempt* has been made to deliver the command to the device. However, it is unclear if the device has received (or processed) the command.
- The device has acknowledged the reception of the command but has not processed the command yet.

An application can determine the overall outcome of the operation by means of the response to the command that is sent back by the device. An application should consider execution of a command to have failed, if it does not receive a response within a reasonable amount of time.

**Response Message Format**

The following table provides an overview of the properties set on a message sent in response to a command.

| Name             | Mandatory | Location                 | Type         | Description |
| :--------------- | :-------: | :----------------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| *content-type*   | no        | *properties*             | *string*     | If present, MUST contain a *Media Type* as defined by [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046) which describes the semantics and format of the command's input data contained in the message payload. However, not all protocol adapters will support this property as not all transport protocols provide means to convey this information, e.g. MQTT 3.1.1 has no notion of message headers. |
| *correlation-id* | yes       | *properties*             | *message-id* | MUST contain the correlation ID used to match the command message with the response message containing the result of execution on the device. |
| *status*         | yes       | *application-properties* | *integer*    | MUST indicate the status of the execution. See table below for possible values. |

The *status* property must contain a valid HTTP status code: <a name="status"></a>

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| *2xx* | The command has been processed successfully. |
| *4xx* | The command could not be processed due to a client error, e.g. malformed message payload. |
| *5xx* | The command could not be processed due to a problem at the device side, e.g. device is not connected. |

The semantics of the individual codes are specific to the device and command. For status codes indicating an error (codes in the `400 - 599` range) the message body MAY contain a detailed description of the error that occurred.

If a command message response contains a payload, the body of the message MUST consist of a single AMQP *Data* section containing the response message data.

**Examples**

The following sequence diagram illustrates how a *Business Application* sends a command and receives the response from the device:

![Successfully send a Command](../command_control_success.png)

The sending of a command may fail for the same reasons as those illustrated for sending a one-way command. Additionally, the sending of a command may be considered unsuccessful by an application if it does not receive the response from the device in a reasonable amount of time:

![Command times out](../command_control_response_time_out.png)


## Strategies for Building the Receiver Link Address

While the `${reply_id}` may be chosen arbitrarily by the client, the specific use case for sending commands should be considered when doing so.
The following hints might help with creating an appropriate `${reply_id}`:

- if only one command response is expected from the device, the `${reply_id}` could be set to the `${device_id}` plus an arbitrary string to scope the command sender instance and closed again after receiving the response.
- if several command responses are expected from the device (e.g. since multiple commands were or will be sent to it), such a link should usually remain open after the reception of any response. 
- if all command responses for the `${tenant_id}` shall be received in the application, the `${reply_id}` could be set to just an arbitrary (short) string to scope the command sender instance (without the `${device_id}`). Such a link should usually remain open after the reception of any response.
