The *Dispatch Router*, together with the *Apache Artemis* message broker, serves as the default *AMQP 1.0 Messaging Network* that is used in Hono's example deployment as described in the [Getting Started Guide]({{< relref "getting-started.md" >}}).
<!--more-->

The Dispatch Router component exposes service endpoints implementing the *north bound* part of Eclipse Hono&trade;'s [Telemetry]({{< relref "api/Telemetry-API.md" >}}) and [Event]({{< relref "api/Event-API.md" >}}) APIs.
The north bound API is used by applications to consume telemetry data and events from connected devices.


## Dispatch Router Configuration

The Dispatch Router is part of the [Apache Qpid project](https://qpid.apache.org). Hono uses Dispatch Router by means of the [EnMasse project's Dispatch Router Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/enmasseproject/qdrouterd-base/) created from the Qpid project source code.

The Dispatch Router can be configured by means of configuration files. Hono includes an example configuration in the `deploy/src/main/config/qpid` folder which is used by the example deployment scripts. Please refer to the [Dispatch Router documentation](https://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router/index.html) for details regarding the configuration file format and options.

## Run Dispatch Router as a Docker Swarm Service

The Dispatch Router can be run as a Docker container from the command line. The following commands create and start the Dispatch Router as a Docker Swarm service using the default keys and configuration file contained in the `example` and `demo-certs` modules:

~~~sh
~/hono$ docker secret create qdrouter-key.pem demo-certs/certs/qdrouter-key.pem
~/hono$ docker secret create qdrouter-cert.pem demo-certs/certs/qdrouter-cert.pem
~/hono$ docker secret create trusted-certs.pem demo-certs/certs/trusted-certs.pem
~/hono$ docker secret create qdrouterd.json deploy/src/main/config/qpid/qdrouterd-with-broker.json
~/hono$ docker service create --detach --name hono-dispatch-router --network hono-net -p 15671:5671 -p 15672:5672 -p 15673:5673 \
>  --secret qdrouter-key.pem \
>  --secret qdrouter-cert.pem \
>  --secret trusted-certs.pem \
>  --secret qdrouterd.json \
>  enmasseproject/qdrouterd-base:1.1.0 /sbin/qdrouterd -c /run/secrets/qdrouterd.json
~~~

{{% note %}}
There are several things noteworthy about the above command to start the Dispatch Router:

1. The *secrets* need to be created once only, i.e. they only need to be removed and re-created if they are changed.
1. The *--network* command line switch is used to specify the *user defined* Docker network that the Dispatch Router should attach to. This is important so that other components can use Docker's DNS service to look up the (virtual) IP address of the Dispatch Router when they want to connect to it. Please refer to the [Docker Networking Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/#/user-defined-networks) for details regarding how to create a *user defined* network in Docker.
1. It is important to specify the configuration file on the Docker command line when starting the container. Otherwise, the Dispatch Router uses the default configuration file included in the Docker image at */etc/qpid-dispatch/qdrouterd.conf* which provides unrestricted access.

## Run Dispatch Router using the Docker Swarm Deployment Script

In most cases it is much easier to start all of Hono's components in one shot using the Docker Swarm deployment script provided in the `deploy/target/deploy/docker` folder.
