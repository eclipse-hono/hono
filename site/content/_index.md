Eclipse Hono&trade; provides remote service interfaces for connecting large numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device communication protocol.

It specifically supports scalable and secure ingestion of large volumes of sensor data by means of its Telemetry and Event APIs. Hono's Command & Control API allows for sending commands (request messages) to devices and receive a reply to such a command from a device asynchronously in a reliable way.

Finally, Hono provides APIs for provisioning & managing the identities and credentials of connected devices.
