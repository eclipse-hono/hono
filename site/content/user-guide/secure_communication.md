The individual components of an Eclipse Hono&trade; installation, e.g. the *Hono server*, *Dispatch Router*, *MQTT adapter* etc, and the clients attaching to Hono in order to send and receive data all communicate with each other using AMQP 1.0 over TCP. The Hono components and the clients will usually not be located on the same local network but will probably communicate over public internet infrastructure. For most use cases it is therefore desirable, if not necessary, to provide for confidentiality of the data being transferred between these components. This section describes how Hono supports confidentiality by means of *Transport Layer Security* (TLS) and how to configure it.

# Enabling TLS

All of Hono's components can be configured to use TLS for establishing an encrypted communication channel with peers. When a client initiates a connection with a server, the TLS handshake protocol is used to negotiate parameters of a secure channel to be used for exchanging data. The most important of those parameters is a secret (symmetric) encryption key that is only known to the client and the server and which is used to transparently encrypt all data being sent over the connection as long as the connection exists. With each new connection, a new secret key is negotiated.

Using TLS in this way requires configuring the server component with a cryptographic *private/public key* pair and a *certificate* which *binds* an *identity claim* to the public key. It is out of scope of this document to describe the full process of creating such a key pair and acquiring a corresponding certificate. The `demo-certs` module already contains a set of keys and certificates to be used for evaluation and demonstration purposes. Throughout the rest of this section we will use these keys and certificates . Please refer to the `demo-certs/README.md` file for details regarding how to create your own keys and certificates.

Within a Hono installation the following communication channels can be secured with TLS:

1. Consumers connecting to *Dispatch Router* - Client applications consuming e.g. Telemetry data from Hono connect to the Dispatch Router component. This connection can be secured by configuring the client and the Dispatch Router for TLS.
1. *Hono Messaging* connecting to *Dispatch Router* - Hono Messaging connects to the Dispatch Router in order to forward telemetry data and commands hence and forth between downstream components (client applications) and devices. This (internal) connection can be secured by configuring the Dispatch Router and Hono Messaging for TLS.
1. *Hono Messaging* connecting to *Auth Server* - Hono Messaging connects to the Auth Server in order to verify client credentials and determine the client's authorities. This (internal) connection can (should) be secured by configuring the Auth Server and Hono Messaging for TLS.
1. *Device Registry* connecting to *Auth Server* - The Device Registry connects to the Auth Server in order to verify client credentials and determine the client's authorities. This (internal) connection can (should) be secured by configuring the Auth Server and Device Registry for TLS.
1. *Protocol Adapter* to *Device Registry* - A protocol adapter connects to the Device Registry in order to retrieve assertions regarding the registration status of devices. This (internal) connection can be secured by configuring the protocol adapter and the Device Registry for TLS.
1. *Protocol Adapter* to *Hono server* - A protocol adapter connects to Hono to e.g. forward telemetry data received from devices to downstream consumers. This (internal) connection can be secured by configuring the protocol adapter and Hono server for TLS.

## Client Application

When the connection between an application client and Hono (i.e. the Dispatch Router) is supposed to be secured by TLS (which is a good idea), then the client application needs to be configured to trust the CA that signed the Dispatch Router's certificate chain. When the application uses the `org.eclipse.hono.client.HonoClientImpl` class from the `client` module, then this can be done by means of configuring the `org.eclipse.hono.connection.ConnectionFactoryImpl` with a trust store containing the CA's certificate. Please refer to that class' JavaDocs for more information.

The `demo-certs/certs` folder contains the following demo keys to be used with client applications for that purpose.

| File                      | Description                                                      |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trusted-certs.pem`     | Trusted CA certificates to use for verifying signatures. |
