The Device Registry component provides exemplary implementations of Hono's [Tenant API]({{< relref "api/Tenant-API.md" >}}), [Device Registration API]({{< relref "api/Device-Registration-API.md" >}}) and [Credentials API]({{< relref "api/Credentials-API.md" >}}).

<!--more-->
As such it exposes AMQP 1.0 based endpoints for retrieving the relevant information and persists data in the local filesystem. 

In addition, the Device Registry also exposes HTTP resources for managing the contents of the registry.

{{% warning %}}
The Device Registry is not intended to be used in production environments. In particular, access to the HTTP resources described below is not restricted to authorized clients only.

The resources have been designed to provide convenient access to the registry's content using command line tools like *curl* or *HTTPie*.
{{% /warning %}}

Please note that the HTTP resources exposed by the Device Registry are **not** part of the *official* definition of the Device Registration, Credentials and Tenant APIs.

## Managing Tenants

(since Hono 0.6)

The following sections describe the resources representing the operations of the Tenant API and how they can be used to manage tenants.
Please refer to the [Tenant API]({{< relref "api/Tenant-API.md" >}}) for the specific elements that are explained in detail there.

### Add a Tenant

* URI: `/tenant`
* Method: `POST`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Request Payload]({{< relref "api/Tenant-API.md#request-payload" >}}) of the Tenant API. The object also needs to contain the tenant's identifier in the `tenant-id` property.
* Status Codes:
  * 201 (Created): Tenant has been added successfully under the resource indicated by `Location` header.
  * 400 (Bad Request): The tenant has not been created because the request was malformed, e .g. because the payload was malformed. The response body may contain hints regarding the cause of the problem.
  * 409 (Conflict): A tenant with the given `tenant-id` already exists. The request has not been processed.
* Response Headers:
  * `Location`: The URI under which the newly created resource can be accessed.

**Example**

The following commands add some tenants with different adapter configurations:

Add a tenant that has all adapters set to enabled:

    $ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
        "tenant-id": "tenantAllAdapters"
      }' http://localhost:28080/tenant
    
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location:  /tenant/tenantAllAdapters
    Content-Length: 0

Add a tenant that can only use the MQTT adapter:

    $ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
        "tenant-id": "tenantMqttAdapter",
        "adapters" : [ {
            "type" : "hono-mqtt",
            "enabled" : true
            } ]
      }' http://localhost:28080/tenant
    
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location:  /tenant/tenantMqttAdapter
    Content-Length: 0

### Get configuration details of a Tenant

* URI: `/tenant/${tenantId}`
* Method: `GET`
* Status Codes:
  * 200 (OK): A tenant with the given identifier has been found. The response body contains the tenant data as specified by [Response Payload]({{< relref "api/Tenant-API.md#response-payload" >}}) of the Tenant API.
  * 404 (Not Found): No tenant with the given identifier is registered.

**Example**

The following command retrieves the details for the tenant `tenantMqttAdapter`:

    $ curl -i http://localhost:28080/tenant/tenantMqttAdapter
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 172
    
    {
         "tenant-id" : "tenantMqttAdapter",
         "enabled" : true,
         "adapters" : [ {
             "type" : "hono-mqtt",
             "enabled" : true
         } ]
    }

### Update Tenant

* URI: `/tenant/${tenantId}`
* Method: `PUT`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Request Payload]({{< relref "api/Tenant-API.md#request-payload" >}}) of the Tenant API.
* Status Codes:
  * 204 (No Content): The tenant has been updated successfully.
  * 400 (Bad Request): The tenant has not been updated because the request was malformed, e .g. because the payload was malformed. The response body may contain hints regarding the cause of the problem.
  * 404 (Not Found): The request could not be processed because no tenant with the given identifier exists.

This resource can be used to change the configuration of a particular tenant.

**Example**

The following command disables the MQTT adapter for devices that belong to the tenant `tenantMqttAdapter`:

    $ curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
          "adapters" : [ {
              "type" : "hono-mqtt",
              "enabled" : true
              } ]
      }' http://localhost:28080/tenant/tenantMqttAdapter
    
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Content-Length: 0


### Delete Tenant

* URI: `/tenant/${tenantId}`
* Method: `DELETE`
* Status Codes:
  * 204 (No Content): The tenant with the given identifier has been deleted.
  * 404 (Not Found): The request could not be processed because no tenant with the given identifier exists.

**Example**

    $ curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:28080/tenant/tenantMqttAdapter
    
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Content-Length: 0

## Managing Device Registration Information

The following sections describe the resources representing the operations of the [Device Registration API]({{< relref "api/Device-Registration-API.md" >}}) and how they can be used to manage device registration information.

### Register Device

* URI: `/registration/${tenantId}`
* Method: `POST`
* Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json`
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Request Payload]({{< relref "api/Device-Registration-API.md#request-payload" >}}) of the Device Registration API. The object also needs to contain the device's identifier in the `device-id` property.
* Status Codes:
  * 201 (Created): Device has been registered successfully under resource indicated by `Location` header.
  * 400 (Bad Request): Device has not been registered because the request was malformed, e .g. a required header is missing (the body may contain hints regarding the problem).
  * 409 (Conflict): There already exists a device with the given ID. The request has not been processed.

**Example**

The following command registers a device with ID `4711`

    $ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
        "device-id": "4711",
        "ep": "IMEI4711"
    }' http://localhost:28080/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT

The response will contain a `Location` header containing the resource path created for the device. In this example it will look
like this:

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location: /registration/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711
    Content-Length: 0

### Read Registration

* URI: `/registration/${tenantId}/${deviceId}`
* Method: `GET`
* Status Codes:
  * 200 (OK): A device with the given identifier has been found. The response body contains the registration information as specified by [Response Payload]({{< relref "api/Device-Registration-API.md#response-payload" >}}) of the Device Registration API.
  * 404 (Not Found): No device with the given identifier is registered for the given tenant.

**Example**

The following command retrieves registration data for device `4711`:

    $ curl -i http://localhost:28080/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 35

    {
      "data" : {
         "enabled": true,
         "ep": "IMEI4711"
      },
      "device-id" : "4711"
    }

### Update Registration

* URI: `/registration/${tenantId}/${deviceId}`
* Method: `PUT`
* Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json`
* Parameters (encoded as a JSON object in the request body):
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Request Payload]({{< relref "api/Device-Registration-API.md#request-payload" >}}) of the Device Registration API. All existing registration information will be replaced by the data provided in the object.
* Status Codes:
  * 204 (No Content): Device registration data has been updated.
  * 400 (Bad Request): Device registration has not been updated because the request was malformed, e .g. a required header is missing (the body may contain hints regarding the problem).
  * 404 (Not Found): No device with the given identifier is registered for the given tenant.

**Example**

    $ curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
        "ep": "IMEI4711",
        "psk-id": "psk4711"
    }' http://localhost:28080/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711

**Example**

    $ curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:28080/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711
    
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Content-Length: 0
    
## Managing Credentials

The following sections describe the resources representing the operations of the Credentials API and how they can be used to manage credentials for devices.
Please refer to the [Credentials API]({{< relref "api/Credentials-API.md" >}}) for the specific elements that are explained in detail there.

### Add Credentials for a Device

* URI: `/credentials/${tenantId}`
* Method: `POST`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Credentials Format]({{< relref "api/Credentials-API.md#credentials-format" >}}) of the Credentials API.
* Status Codes:
  * 201 (Created): Credentials have been added successfully under the resource indicated by `Location` header.
  * 400 (Bad Request): The credentials have not been added because the request was malformed, e .g. because the payload did not contain required values. The response body may contain hints regarding the cause of the problem.
  * 409 (Conflict): Credentials of the given type for the given *auth-id* already exist for the tenant. The request has not been processed.
* Response Headers:
  * `Location`: The URI under which the newly created resource can be accessed.

**Example**

The following command adds some `hashed-password` credentials from a given plain text password for device `4710` using authentication identifier `sensor10`: 

    $ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
      "device-id": "4710",
      "type": "hashed-password",
      "auth-id": "sensor10",
      "secrets": [{
          "pwd-plain": "mylittlesecret"
      }]
    }' http://localhost:28080/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT
      
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location: /credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/sensor10/hashed-password
    Content-Length: 0
    
This uses a convenient option which lets the Device Registry do the hashing of the password. The following command retrieves the credentials that are stored by the Device Registry as a result of the command above: 
    
    
    $ curl -i http://localhost:28080/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4710
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 222

    {
      "total": 1,
      "credentials": [
        {
          "device-id": "4710",
          "type": "hashed-password",
          "auth-id": "sensor10",
          "enabled": true,
          "secrets": [
            {
              "pwd-hash": "$2a$10$uc.qVDwXeDRE1DWa1sM9iOaY9wuevjfALGMtXmHKP.SJDEqg0q7M6",
              "hash-function": "bcrypt"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    
    
The following commands add some `hashed-password` credentials for device `4720` using authentication identifier `sensor20`:

    $ PWD_HASH=$(echo -n "mylittlesecret" | openssl dgst -binary -sha512 | base64 -w 0)
    $ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
        "device-id": "4720",
        "type": "hashed-password",
        "auth-id": "sensor20",
        "secrets": [{
            "hash-function" : "sha-512",
            "pwd-hash": "'$PWD_HASH'"
        }]
      }' http://localhost:28080/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT
    
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location: /credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/sensor20/hashed-password
    Content-Length: 0

Multiple credentials of different type can be registered for the same authentication identifier.
The following commands add `psk` credentials for the same device `4720` using authentication identifier `sensor20`:

    $ SHARED_KEY=$(echo -n "TheSharedKey" | base64 -w 0)
    $ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
       "device-id": "4720",
       "type": "psk",
       "auth-id": "sensor20",
       "secrets": [{
         "key" : "'$SHARED_KEY'"
         }]
      }' http://localhost:28080/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT
    
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location: /credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/sensor20/psk
    Content-Length: 0


### Get Credentials by Authentication Identifier and Type

* URI: `/credentials/${tenantId}/${authId}/${type}`
* Method: `GET`
* Status Codes:
  * 200 (OK): Credentials for the given parameters have been found. The response body will contain credentials as specified by [Credentials Format]({{< relref "api/Credentials-API.md#credentials-format" >}}) of the Credentials API.
  * 404 (Not Found): No credentials for the given parameters are registered for the given tenant.

The [Get Credentials]({{< relref "api/Credentials-API.md#get-credentials" >}}) operation of Credentials API defines that arbitrary array of properties can be passed to help identify the device.
It's not specified if and how these properties can be used by the implementation. The Device Registry will try to match the
properties against the properties defined in the credentials record. It will return the credentials only if all the properties in the request are successfully matched.

**Example**

The following command retrieves credentials data of type `hashed-password` for the authentication identifier `sensor20`:

    $ curl -i http://localhost:28080/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/sensor20/hashed-password
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 268
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    
    {
        "auth-id": "sensor20",
        "device-id": "4720",
        "enabled": true,
        "secrets": [
            {
                "hash-function": "sha-512",
                "pwd-hash": "tnxz0zDFs+pJGdCVSuoPE4TnamXsfIjBEOb0rg3e9WFD9KfbCkoRuwVZKgRWInfqp87kCLsoV/HEwdJwgw793Q=="
            }
        ],
        "type": "hashed-password"
    }


### Get all Credentials for a Device

* URI: `/credentials/${tenantId}/${deviceId}`
* Method: `GET`
* Status Codes:
  * 200 (OK): Credentials for the device have been found, body contains the credentials.
  The body differs from the body for a specific type since it may contain an arbitrary number of credentials. It contains a property `total` indicating the total number of credentials returned. The credentials are contained in property `credentials`.
  * 404 (Not Found): No credentials for the device are registered.

**Example**

The following command retrieves credentials for device `4720`:

    $ curl -i http://localhost:28080/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4720
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 491
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    
    {
        "credentials": [
            {
                "auth-id": "sensor20",
                "device-id": "4720",
                "enabled": true,
                "secrets": [
                    {
                        "hash-function": "sha-512",
                        "pwd-hash": "tnxz0zDFs+pJGdCVSuoPE4TnamXsfIjBEOb0rg3e9WFD9KfbCkoRuwVZKgRWInfqp87kCLsoV/HEwdJwgw793Q=="
                    }
                ],
                "type": "hashed-password"
            },
            {
                "auth-id": "sensor20",
                "device-id": "4720",
                "enabled": true,
                "secrets": [
                    {
                        "key": "VGhlU2hhcmVkS2V5"
                    }
                ],
                "type": "psk"
            }
        ],
        "total": 2
    }


### Update Credentials

* URI: `/credentials/${tenantId}/${authId}/${type}`
* Method: `PUT`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Credentials Format]({{< relref "api/Credentials-API.md#credentials-format" >}}) of the Credentials API.
* Status Codes:
  * 204 (No Content): The credentials have been updated successfully.
  * 400 (Bad Request): The credentials have not been updated because the request was malformed, e .g. because the payload did not contain required values or the type and auth-id in the payload do not match the path parameters. The response body may contain hints regarding the cause of the problem.
  * 404 (Not Found): The request could not be processed because there exist no credentials of the given type and authentication identifier.

This resource can be used to change values of a particular set of credentials. However, it cannot be used to change the type or authentication identifier of the credentials.

**Example**

The following command adds an expiration date to the `hashed-password` credentials for authentication identifier `sensor20`:

    $ PWD_HASH=$(echo -n "mylittlesecret" | openssl dgst -binary -sha512 | base64 -w 0)
    $ curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
        "device-id": "4720",
        "type": "hashed-password",
        "auth-id": "sensor20",
        "secrets": [{
            "hash-function" : "sha-512",
            "pwd-hash": "'$PWD_HASH'",
            "not-after": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"
        }]
