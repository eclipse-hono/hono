The Kura protocol adapter exposes an MQTT topic hierarchy allowing Eclipse Kura&trade; based gateways to publish *control* and *data* messages to Eclipse Hono&trade;'s Telemetry and Event endpoints.
<!--more-->

The Kura adapter by default requires devices (gateways) to authenticate during connection establishment. In order to do so, gateways need to provide a *username* and a *password* in the MQTT *CONNECT* packet. The *username* must have the form *auth-id@tenant*, e.g. `sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT`. The adapter verifies the credentials provided by the gateway against the credentials the [configured Credentials service]({{< relref "#credentials-service-configuration" >}}) has on record for the gateway. The adapter uses the Credentials API's *get* operation to retrieve the credentials-on-record with the *tenant* and *auth-id* provided by the device in the *username* and `hashed-password` as the *type* of secret as query parameters.

Please refer to the [Eclipse Kura documentation](http://eclipse.github.io/kura/cloud/kura-cloud.html) on how to configure the gateway's cloud service connection accordingly. It is important to set the gateway's *topic.context.account-name* to the ID of the Hono tenant that the gateway has been registered with whereas the gateway's *client-id* needs to be set to the corresponding Hono device ID. The *auth-id* used as part of the gateway's *username* property needs to match the authentication identifier of a set of credentials registered for the device ID in Hono's Credentials service. In other words, the credentials configured on the gateway need to belong to the corresponding device ID.

Once the gateway has established a connection to the Kura adapter, all *control* and *data* messages published by applications running on the gateway are sent to the adapter and mapped to Hono's Telemetry and Event API endpoints as follows:

1. The adapter treats all messages that are published to a topic starting with the configured `HONO_KURA_CONTROL_PREFIX` as control messages. All other messages are considered to be data messages.
1. *control* messages with QoS 0 are forwarded to Hono's telemetry endpoint whereas messages with QoS 1 are forwarded to the event endpoint. The corresponding AMQP 1.0 messages that are sent downstream have a content type of `application/vnd.eclipse.kura-control`.
1. *data* messages with QoS 0 are forwarded to the telemetry endpoint whereas messages with QoS 1 are forwarded to the event endpoint. The corresponding AMQP 1.0 messages that are sent downstream have a content type of `application/vnd.eclipse.kura-data`.

## Downstream Meta Data

The adapter includes the following meta data in messages being sent downstream:

| Name               | Location        | Type      | Description                                                     |
| :----------------- | :-------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `orig_adapter`   | *application*   | *string*  | Contains the adapter's *type name* which can be used by downstream consumers to determine the protocol adapter that the message has been received over. The Kura adapter's type name is `hono-kura-mqtt`. |
| `orig_address`   | *application*   | *string*  | Contains the name of the MQTT topic that the Kura gateway has originally published the data to. |

The adapter also considers [*defaults* registered for the device]({{< relref "api/Device-Registration-API.md#payload-format" >}}). For each default value the adapter checks if a corresponding property is already set on the message and if not, sets the message's property to the registered default value or adds a corresponding application property.

Note that of the standard AMQP 1.0 message properties only the `content-type` can be set this way to a registered default value.
