All the Eclipse Hono&trade; components can be deployed on Kubernetes, thanks to the resources YAML files that are provided through the repository.
These files describe such components in terms of _deployments_ and _services_ in order to have the right pods running in the Kubernetes cluster so that they are able
to communicate with each other.

## Prerequisites

The main prerequisite for this kind of deployment is to have an available Kubernetes cluster. For a local development, it's pretty simple having such cluster using Minikube 
which is a tool that helps you run Kubernetes locally by running a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. Follow [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/)
for installing and having Minikube up and running.

The other prerequisite is to have the Kubectl command line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster. Follow [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) 
for installing and configuring such a tool.

After launching Minikube and before building the Eclipse Hono images, it's necessary to execute the following command :

~~~sh
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)
~~~

In this way, the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable is set to the Docker daemon running inside the Minikube VM. Launching the following command for building the Eclipse Hono images,
such daemon will be used and the final images will be available inside the Minikube VM, ready for the deployment.

~~~sh
~/hono$ mvn clean install -Pbuild-docker-image
~~~

## Script based Deployment

In order to deploy Eclipse Hono on Kubernetes, a bunch of steps are needed as explained in the next chapter. If you want to avoid to do them manually, a _one click_ deployment
script is available in the repository.
After having the Kubernetes cluster up and running and the `kubectl` command line tool in the PATH, the deployment can be done by running the following bash script
(from the `example/target/deploy/kubernetes` directory)

~~~sh
~hono/example/target/deploy/kubernetes$ chmod +x *.sh
~hono/example/target/deploy/kubernetes$ ./kubernetes_deploy.sh
~~~

In order to see the deployed components, you can launch Kubernetes' web UI in a browser by issuing:

~~~sh
$ minikube dashboard
~~~

Be sure to switch to the `hono` namespace in the UI in order to see the components deployed as part of Hono.
In the following pictures an Eclipse Hono deployment on Kubernetes is running with all the provided components.

### Undeploying Hono

There also is a script for shutting down and undeploying Hono:

~~~sh
~hono/example/target/deploy/kubernetes$ ./kubernetes_undeploy.sh
~~~

## Deploying individual Components

You may also deploy each of Hono's components separately by copying the relevant commands from the deploy script to your own script or entering them directly on the command line.

## Accessing Hono Services

The Kubernetes deployment provides access to Eclipse Hono by means of *services* and the main ones are:

* **hono-dispatch-router-ext**: router network for the business application in order to consume data
* **hono-adapter-mqtt-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the MQTT protocol
* **hono-adapter-rest-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the HTTP protocol
* **hono-service-device-registry**: component for registering and managing devices

You can check these services through the `kubectl get services --namespace hono` command having the following output :

~~~sh

These services are accessible using the Minikube VM's IP address (which you can get with the `minikube ip` command) and the so called *node ports* (i.e. 30080, 30671, ...).
In the following sections `<IP_ADDRESS>` needs to be replaced with the IP address of the Minikube VM.

### Starting a Consumer

As described in the [Getting Started]({{< relref "getting-started.md" >}}) guide, data produced by devices is usually consumed by downstream applications which connect directly to the router network service.
You can start the client from the `example` folder as follows:

~~~sh
~/hono/example$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments=--hono.client.host=<IP_ADDRESS>,--hono.client.port=30671,--hono.client.username=consumer@HONO,--hono.client.password=verysecret
~~~

### Uploading Telemetry

In order to upload telemetry data to Hono, the device needs to be registered with the system. You can register the device using the
*Device Registry* by running the following command (i.e. for a device with ID `4711`):

~~~sh
$ curl -X POST -i -d 'device-id=4711' http://<IP_ADDRESS>:31080/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT
~~~

After having the device registered, uploading telemetry is just a simple HTTP PUT command to the *REST Adapter*:

~~~sh
$ curl -X PUT -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{"temp": 5}' \
> http://<IP_ADDRESS>:30080/telemetry/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711
~~~

Other than using the *REST Adapter*, it's possible to upload telemetry data using the *MQTT Adapter* as well:

~~~sh
mosquitto_pub -h <IP_ADDRESS> -p 31883 -i 4711 -t telemetry/DEFAULT_TENANT/4711 -m '{"temp": 5}'
~~~
