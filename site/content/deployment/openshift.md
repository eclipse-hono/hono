This guide describes how to deploy Eclipse Hono™ using EnMasse as messaging
backend on a single-master/single-node local OpenShift installation using
"minishift".

<!--more-->

All the Eclipse Hono&trade; components can be deployed on OpenShift, thanks to
the resources YAML files that are provided through the repository. These files
describe such components in terms of _deployments_ and _services_ in order to
have the right pods running in the OpenShift cluster so that they are able
to communicate with each other.

{{% warning title="Use for demos only" %}}
The intention of this deployment example is to provide a very simple to
replicate setup of Hono based on OpenShift. It is mostly suitable for
developing, testing and demo purposes. For full production usage, you'll need
to consider the following topics which are not covered by this example
deployment:

* Running EnMasse with full authentication enabled
* Integration between EnMasse and Hono authentication
* Configuring and supporting multi-tenancy in both platforms

These are all subjects to current and future developments in this area. This
document will be updated accordingly with the progress. 
{{% /warning %}}

## Prerequisites

The main prerequisite for this kind of deployment is to have an available
OpenShift cluster. For local development purposes it is pretty simple to start
up such a cluster using "minishift". It will run a single node/single master
OpenShift cluster inside a virtual machine on your local computer.

You should have the following tools installed on your local system:

* OpenShift Origin client tools, 3.7.x+ – required to communicate with the
  OpenShift cluster
* Minishift, 1.13.x+ – required to run local OpenShift cluster
* Bash – required to execute setup scripts

In case you want to use an existing OpenShift cluster you only need the the
"client tools" don't need to install "minishift".

### OpenShift Origin client tools

The client tools can be downloaded from the
[OpenShift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases) project
repository. Simply download the archive, unpack it and drop it into a directory
where it can be found by the local PATH lookup.
 
### Minishift

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a
single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. Follow
[this guide](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html)
for installing and having Minishift up and running.

OpenShift limits the number of pods you can start by the number of system
resources available. Minishift will only provide a small subset of your host
machine resources by default. However this is too limited for a Hono deployment
and so the following start command has to be used in order to provide enough
resources to the Minishift instance:

~~~sh
$ minishift start --cpus 4 --memory 8GB --disk-size 40GB
~~~

{{% note title="Resource limits" %}}
Once you created your Minishift cluster instance with `minishift start` the
resource arguments (like `--cpus`) are ignored in future calls to
`minishift start` as the virtual machine has already been created. You will
need to destroy the instance using `minishift delete` before it will accept
the new resource limits.
{{% /note %}}

After Minishift has been started up, the following steps need to be performed:

1. Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to point to the Docker daemon
    running inside the Minishift VM and set path to the OpenShift command line
    utilities
    
    ~~~sh
    $ eval $(minishift docker-env)
    $ eval $(minishift oc-env)
    ~~~

1. Build the Hono Docker images and deploy them to the Docker registry in the
    Minishift instance
    
    ~~~sh
    ~/hono$ mvn clean install -Pbuild-docker-image
    ~~~

Those two steps will run a Hono build on your local machine and assemble the
docker images on the Docker registry running inside the Minishift instance.

## Create a new project

In this setup everything will be deployed into a single OpenShift project. We
do need to create this project before executing the next steps. A new project
can be created by executing the following command from the command line:

~~~sh
$ oc new-project hono
~~~

{{% note title="Project name" %}}
This tutorial and all scripts assume that the project name will be `hono`. If
you choose a different name, you will need to adapt commands and shell scripts
accordingly. It is strongly recommended to stick to the default name `hono`.
{{% /note %}}

## Deploy EnMasse

This deployment will use EnMasse as its messaging backend. So the first thing
we need is to run EnMasse messaging platform on OpenShift in a project
called `hono`. For that, download the EnMasse release from the
[download page](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/releases).
These instructions were tested using version `0.20.0`. Newer versions might
work as well, but are not tested. Extract the EnMasse release and execute
the following command from the newly created directory:

~~~sh
./deploy.sh -n hono -m https://$(minishift ip):8443
~~~

This should get the installation of EnMasse running. For more information on
how to run and configure EnMasse, take a look at the
[EnMasse documentation](http://enmasse.io/documentation/).

{{% note title="Be patient" %}}
The deployment of EnMasse will pull a few docker images during the startup
process. It is recommended to wait until all 7 pods are running and OK.
{{% /note %}}

When the EnMasse deployment is complete, the Minishift dashboard of the `hono`
project should look something like this:

![EnMasse Ready](../openshift_09_enmasse_ready.png)

## Script based Deployment

Now we are ready to deploy Hono. From the
`deploy/target/deploy/openshift` directory, run:

~~~sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/openshift$ bash ./openshift_deploy.sh
~~~

This should start all necessary Hono components, configured to connect to the
EnMasse instance running in the same project.

The script will try to use Minishift cluster address by default. If you wish
to deploy Hono to some other OpenShift cluster, you must specify the address
of the cluster as an argument, like:

~~~sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/openshift$ bash ./openshift_deploy.sh https://192.168.64.3:8443
~~~

In order to see the deployed components, you can launch OpenShift's web UI
in a browser by issuing:

~~~sh
$ minishift dashboard
~~~

You can login with username `developer` and password `developer`. Be sure
to switch to the `Eclipse Hono` project in the UI in order to see the
components deployed as part of Hono.

The screenshots below show Hono's components deployed to OpenShift:

{{< figure src="../openshift_01_hono_ready.png"
 caption="Hono dashbaord in OpenShift"
 alt="Screenshot of OpenShift showing Hono deployment state"
 >}}

## Undeploying Hono

There also is a script for shutting down and undeploying Hono:

~~~sh
~hono/deploy/target/deploy/openshift$ bash ./openshift_undeploy.sh
~~~

{{% note title="Be patient" %}}
Undeploying the project will take a short moment. If you try to re-created the
`hono` project before the cleanup is complete you will receive an error that
the project `hono` cannot be created because it already (still) exists.
{{% /note %}}

## Extract Certificate

In order to connect the external consumer to EnMasse, we need to use a
proper SSL certificate. We can extract one from the OpenShift using the
following command (from the `example` directory):

~~~sh
~hono/deploy$ oc extract secret/external-certs-messaging --to=target/config/hono-demo-certs-jar/ -n hono
~~~

This will create two new files with the key and certificate which we will
use to connect the Hono consumer.

## Access to Hono services

The OpenShift deployment provides access to Eclipse Hono by means of
*services*, the main ones are:

* **messaging**: router network for the business application in order to consume data
* **hono-adapter-mqtt-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the MQTT protocol
* **hono-adapter-http-vertx**: protocol adapter for publishing telemetry data and events using the HTTP protocol
* **hono-service-device-registry**: component for registering and managing devices

You can check these services through the `oc get services` command having the following output :

Services are accessed from the "outside" of OpenShift using "routes", which
map external traffic to internal services. You can get a list of all routes
from the project by executing `oc get routes`, which should give you the
following output:

In the following sections, when using a hostname, we will be using the hostnames
as provided by the "get routes" command above. Using Minishift or a real
OpenShift cluster, it works the same way.

### Starting a Consumer

As described in the [Getting Started]({{< relref "getting-started.md" >}})
guide, data produced by devices is usually consumed by downstream applications
which connect directly to the router network service. You can start the client
from the `example` folder as follows:

~~~sh
~hono/example$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments=--hono.client.host=$(oc get route messaging --template='{{.spec.host}}'),--hono.client.port=443,--hono.client.trustStorePath=target/config/hono-demo-certs-jar/tls.crt
~~~

### Uploading Telemetry with HTTP

In order to upload telemetry data to Hono, the device needs to be registered
with the system. You can register the device using the *Device Registry* by
running the following command (i.e. for a device with ID `4711`):

~~~sh
$ curl -X POST -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"device-id": "4711"}' http://$(oc get route hono-service-device-registry-http --template='{{.spec.host}}')/registration/DEFAULT_TENANT
~~~

After having the device registered, uploading telemetry is just a simple
HTTP POST command to the *HTTP Adapter*:

~~~sh
$ curl -X POST -i -u sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT:hono-secret -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{"temp": 5}' http://$(oc get route hono-adapter-http-vertx --template='{{.spec.host}}')/telemetry
~~~

{{% note title="503 Service unavailable" %}}
You might run into the issue that the previous HTTP POST operation returns
`503 Service Unavailable`. In this case the HTTP protocol adapter has no
"credit", meaning it has no downstream consumer which would accept the message.

This will be the case when you have no consumer running. So before uploading
telemetry data you need to ensure that at least one consumer is running as
described in [Starting a consumer](#starting-a-consumer).
{{% /note %}}

### Uploading Telemetry with MQTT

Other than using the *HTTP Adapter*, it's possible to upload telemetry data
using the *MQTT Adapter* as well:

~~~sh
$ mosquitto_pub -h $(minishift ip) -p 31883 -u 'sensor1@DEFAULT_TENANT' -P hono-secret -t telemetry -m '{"temp": 5}'
~~~

{{% note title="Mosquitto TLS SNI support" %}}
As of writing Mosquitto (which provides the `mosquitto_pub`) command doesn't
support TLS SNI, which is however required when using MQTT with OpenShift
routes. The workaround is to use the "Node port" as in the example above.

Other MQTT clients do not have this limitations so using TLS with SNI should
be preferred in this case.
{{% /note %}}

### Usernames & passwords

The username and password used above for device `4711` are part of the example
configuration that comes with Hono.
See [Device Identity]({{< relref "concepts/device-identity.md" >}}) for an
explanation of how devices are identified in Hono and how device identity is
related to authentication.
