## Report an Issue

The easiest way to tell us about a problem you experience with Hono is by [opening an issue on our GitHub page](https://github.com/eclipse/hono/issues).

Please make sure to search the existing issues for similar symptoms before you open a new issue.

## Chat

The most direct way of interacting with the Hono developers is by means of [joining the #eclipse-hono IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&prompt=1&channels=#eclipse-hono).

Please don't be disappointed if you do not immediately get an answer to your inquiry, most of us are working on multiple projects and thus do not always find the time to answer promptly. However, we usually do our best to follow the chat with at least one eye ...

## Mailing List

An excellent way to get the latest news and announcements around Hono is to [join the mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/hono-dev). This is the place where we announce new releases and discuss architectural issues of greater impact.

## Road Map

Last but not least, we are trying our best to anticipate the needs and requirements of users based on the feedback we get via the various channels described above. From this information we maintain a [Road Map](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hono/governance) for the next several releases.

We try to maintain a steady pace of releases every three months with milestones in between. However, due to changes in requirements over time and because we all have only limited time to spend on Hono, the scope of the releases may change over time as well. The best way to make sure that a certain feature that you anticipate or need the most actually makes it into a release, is by [becoming a contributor]({{< relref "/community/contributing.md" >}}) and/or committer to Hono yourself.
