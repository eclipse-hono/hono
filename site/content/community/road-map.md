We are trying our best to anticipate the needs and requirements of users based on the feedback we get from users. From this information we maintain a [Road Map](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hono/governance) for the next several releases.
<!--more-->

We try to maintain a steady pace of releases every three months with milestones in between. However, due to changes in requirements over time and because we all have only limited time to spend on Hono, the scope of the releases may change over time as well. The best way to make sure that a certain feature that you anticipate or need the most actually makes it into a release, is by [becoming a contributor]({{< relref "contributing.md" >}}) and/or committer to Hono yourself.
