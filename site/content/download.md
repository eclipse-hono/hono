## Binaries

The preferred way of deploying Eclipse Hono&trade; is by means of using the pre-built Docker images provided
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipsehono/).

The most convenient way to both pull the images and start corresponding containers is by means of
[deploying a *stack* using Docker's *Swarm Mode*](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/). You can find an example stack definition using the published Hono images in the release archive:

* [Eclipse Hono 0.5-M8 Archive](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/eclipse-hono-example-0.5-M8.tar.gz)

After downloading the archive, extract it to a local folder, change into that folder and run the following from the command line (assuming that you have Docker Engine running in Swarm mode):

~~~sh
eclipse-hono-example-0.5-M8$ deploy/docker/swarm_deploy.sh
~~~

You may also want to consider other [deployment options]({{< relref "deployment/openshift.md" >}}).
