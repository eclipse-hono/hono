The Device Registry component provides exemplary implementations of Hono's [Tenant API]({{< relref "/api/tenant" >}}), [Device Registration API]({{< relref "/api/device-registration" >}}) and [Credentials API]({{< relref "/api/credentials" >}}).

<!--more-->
As such it exposes AMQP 1.0 based endpoints for retrieving the relevant information and persists data in the local filesystem. 

In addition, the Device Registry also exposes HTTP resources for managing the contents of the registry according to the [Device Registry HTTP API]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}).

{{% warning %}}
The Device Registry is not intended to be used in production environments. In particular, access to the HTTP resources described below is not restricted to authorized clients only.

The resources have been designed to provide convenient access to the registry's content using command line tools like *curl* or *HTTPie*.

## Managing Tenants

The following sections describe the resources representing the operations of the Tenant API and how they can be used to manage tenants.
Please refer to the [Device Registry HTTP API]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) for the specific elements that are explained in detail there.

### Add a Tenant

* URI: `/v1/tenants/${tenantId}`
* Method: `POST`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (Optional) A JSON object as specified by [Tenant schema]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) of the HTTP API specification.
* Status Codes:
  * 201 (Created): Tenant has been added successfully under the resource indicated by `Location` header.
  * 400 (Bad Request): The tenant has not been created because the request was malformed, e .g. because the payload was malformed. The response body may contain hints regarding the cause of the problem.
  * 409 (Conflict): A tenant with the given `tenantId` already exists. The request has not been processed.
* Response Headers:
  * `Location`: The URI under which the newly created resource can be accessed.
  * `ETag`: Version of the resource

**Example**

The following commands add some tenants with different adapter configurations:

Add a tenant that has all adapters set to enabled:

~~~sh
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:28080/v1/tenants/tenantAllAdapters

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: becc93d7-ab0f-48ec-ad26-debdf339cbf4
Location: /v1/tenants/tenantAllAdapters
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"id": "tenantAllAdapters"}
~~~

Add a tenant that can only use the MQTT adapter:

~~~sh
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
    "adapters": [ {
        "type": "hono-mqtt",
        "enabled": true
        } ]
  }' http://localhost:28080/v1/tenants/tenantMqttAdapter

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
ETag: becc93d7-ab0f-48ec-ad26-debdf339cbf4
Location:  /v1/tenants/tenantMqttAdapter
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"id": "tenantMqttAdapter"}
~~~

### Get configuration details of a Tenant

* URI: `/v1/tenants/${tenantId}`
* Method: `GET`
* Status Codes:
  * 200 (OK): A tenant with the given identifier has been found. The response body contains the tenant data as specified by [Tenant schema]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) of the HTTP API specification.
  * 404 (Not Found): No tenant with the given identifier is registered.

**Example**

The following command retrieves the details for the tenant `tenantMqttAdapter`:

~~~sh
curl -i http://localhost:28080/v1/tenants/tenantMqttAdapter

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: becc93d7-ab0f-48ec-ad26-debdf339cbf4
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
     "enabled": true,
     "adapters": [ {
         "type": "hono-mqtt",
         "enabled": true
     } ]
}
~~~

**NB** A tenant can be created without specifying a tenant identifier. The device registry will generate a tenant ID: 
~~~sh
curl -i  -X POST http://localhost:28080/v1/tenants/

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Etag: edc93899-7838-4dd1-93c8-839748c2fa42
location: /v1/tenants/0b2df55f-1a02-43f7-a1c0-f3dbd25041e0
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
content-length: 45

{"id":"0b2df55f-1a02-43f7-a1c0-f3dbd25041e0"}
~~~

### Update Tenant

* URI: `/v1/tenants/${tenantId}`
* Method: `PUT`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Tenant schema]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) of the HTTP API specification.
* Status Codes:
  * 204 (No Content): The tenant has been updated successfully.

## Managing Credentials

The following sections describe the resources representing the operations of the Credentials API and how they can be used to manage credentials for devices.
Please refer to the [Device Registry HTTP API]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) for the specific elements that are explained in detail there.

### Update Credentials for a Device

* URI: `/v1/credentials/${tenantId}/${deviceId}`
* Method: `PUT`
* Request Headers:
  * (required) `Content-Type`: `application/json` (no other type supported)
* Request Body:
  * (required) A JSON object as specified by [Credentials schema]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) of the HTTP API specification.
* Status Codes:
  * 204 (No Content): Credentials have been updated successfully.
  * 400 (Bad Request): The credentials have not been added because the request was malformed, e .g. because the payload did not contain required values. The response body may contain hints regarding the cause of the problem.
* Response Headers:
  * `ETag`: Version of the resource

**Example**

The following command adds some `hashed-password` credentials from a given plain text password for device `4710` using authentication identifier `sensor10`: 

~~~sh
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '[{
  "type": "hashed-password",
  "auth-id": "sensor10",
  "secrets": [{
      "pwd-plain": "mylittlesecret"
  }]
}]' http://localhost:28080/v1/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4710
  
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
ETag: becc93d7-ab0f-48ec-ad26-debdf339cbf4x
~~~
    
This uses a convenient option which lets the Device Registry do the hashing of the password. The following command retrieves the credentials that are stored by the Device Registry as a result of the command above: 
 
~~~sh
curl -i http://localhost:28080/v1/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4710

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
ETag: becc93d7-ab0f-48ec-ad26-debdf339cbf4x

[{
  "type": "hashed-password",
  "auth-id": "sensor10",
  "enabled": true,
  "secrets": [
    {
      "id": "349556ea-4902-47c7-beb0-1009ab693fb4"
    }
  ]
}]
~~~
The above result does not contain `pwd_hash` and `hash_function` of the secret, as these values are confidential.

The following commands set some `hashed-password` credentials for device `4720` using authentication identifier `sensor20`:

~~~sh
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '[{
    "type": "hashed-password",
    "auth-id": "sensor20",
    "secrets": [{
        "pwd-plain": "mylittlesecret"
    }]
  }]' http://localhost:28080/v1/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4720

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
ETag: 02c99fb5-af8c-409f-8520-b405e224b27f
~~~

The following command adds an expiration date to the `hashed-password` credentials for authentication identifier `sensor20`:

~~~sh
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{
    "device-id": "4720",
    "type": "hashed-password",
    "auth-id": "sensor20",
    "secrets": [{
        "pwd-plain": "mylittlesecret",
        "not-after": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"
    }]
}' http://localhost:28080/v1/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4720

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
ETag: becc93d7-ab0f-48ec-ad26-debdf339cbf4x
~~~

Multiple credentials of different type can be registered for the same authentication identifier.
The following commands add `psk` credentials for the same device `4720` using authentication identifier `sensor20`:

~~~sh
SHARED_KEY=$(echo -n "TheSharedKey" | base64 -w 0)
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '[
{
    "type": "hashed-password",
    "auth-id": "sensor20",
    "secrets": [{
        "pwd-plain": "mylittlesecret"
    }]
},
{
   "device-id": "4720",
   "type": "psk",
   "auth-id": "sensor20",
   "secrets": [{
     "key": "'$SHARED_KEY'"
     }]
  }]' http://localhost:28080/v1/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4720

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
ETag: 122c971a-505a-4336-8f7d-640360e909bc
~~~

The following command deletes all credentials for device `4710`:

~~~sh
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '[]' http://localhost:28080/v1/credentials/DEFAULT_TENANT/4710

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
ETag: d383ba4d-1853-4d03-b322-b7ff5af05ae2
~~~
