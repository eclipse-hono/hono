The Device Registry component provides exemplary implementations of Hono's [Tenant API]({{< relref "/api/tenant" >}}), [Device Registration API]({{< relref "/api/device-registration" >}}) and [Credentials API]({{< relref "/api/credentials" >}}).

<!--more-->
As such it exposes AMQP 1.0 based endpoints for retrieving the relevant information and persists data to the local file
system.

{{% note title="Deprecation" %}}
The file based device registry has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Hono.
Please use the [Mongo DB]({{< relref "mongodb-based-device-registry" >}}) or
[JDBC based registry]({{< relref "jdbc-based-device-registry" >}}) implementations instead.

In addition, the Device Registry also exposes HTTP resources for managing the contents of the registry according to the
[Device Registry Management API]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}).

{{% warning %}}
The Device Registry is not intended to be used in production environments. In particular, access to the HTTP resources described below is not restricted to authorized clients only.

{{% note %}}

[search tenants]({{< relref "/api/management#tenants/searchTenants" >}}) nor the
[search devices]({{< relref "/api/management#devices/searchDevicesForTenant" >}}) operation.
