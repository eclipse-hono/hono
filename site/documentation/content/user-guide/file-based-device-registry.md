The Device Registry component provides exemplary implementations of Hono's [Tenant API]({{< relref "/api/tenant" >}}),
[Device Registration API]({{< relref "/api/device-registration" >}}) and [Credentials API]({{< relref "/api/credentials" >}}).

<!--more-->
As such it exposes AMQP 1.0 based endpoints for retrieving the relevant information and persists data to the local file
system.

{{% notice info %}}
The file based device registry has been deprecated and will be removed in Hono 2.0.0.
Please use the [Mongo DB]({{< relref "mongodb-device-registry-config" >}}) or
[JDBC based registry]({{< relref "jdbc-device-registry-config" >}}) implementations instead.

In addition, the Device Registry also exposes HTTP resources for managing the contents of the registry according to the
[Device Registry Management API]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}).

{{% notice warning %}}
The Device Registry is not intended to be used in production environments. In particular, access to the HTTP resources
