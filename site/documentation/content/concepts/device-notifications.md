*Business Applications* need to know when an attempt to send a command to device is feasible, e.g. because the device is then known to be connected to a protocol adapter. *Devices* and *Protocol Adapters* can indicate to *Business Applications* a device's intent to e.g. receive commands using specific *notifications*.

## Time until Disconnect Notification

*Devices* and *Protocol Adapters* can notify an application about the fact that a device is connected and ready to receive one or more commands by means of including a *time 'til disconnect* (*ttd*) property in telemetry or event messages.

The *ttd* property value indicates the time that the device will stay connected to the protocol adapter.
Using this value together with the *creation-time* of the message, an application can determine whether an attempt to send a command to the device has a reasonable chance of succeeding.
The *ttd* property can be included in any regular telemetry or event message. However, if a device does not have any telemetry data or event to upload to the adapter, it can also use an [empty notification]({{< relref "/api/event#empty-notification" >}}) instead.

Hono includes utility classes that application developers can use to register a callback to be notified when a device sends a *ttd* notification.
See Hono's example module for details where such a notification callback is used.
Please refer to the [Telemetry API]({{< relref "/api/telemetry" >}}) and the [Event API]({{< relref "/api/event" >}}) for further details.

The following table defines the possible values of the *ttd* property and their semantics:

| TTD  | Description  |
| :--- | :----------- |
| > 0  | The value indicates the number of seconds that the device will stay connected. Devices using a stateless protocol like HTTP will be able to receive a single command only before disconnecting.
| -1   | The device is now connected (i.e. available to receive upstream messages) until further notice.
| 0    | The device is now disconnected (i.e. not available anymore to receive upstream messages).

### Determining a Device's Connection Status 

An application receiving a downstream message containing a *ttd* property can check if the device is currently connected
(and thus ready to receive a command) by

- adding the *ttd* value to the *creation-time* to determine the *expiration* time, and then
- comparing the *current* time with the *expiration* time

If the *current* time is *after* the *expiration* time, the device should be assumed to already have disconnected again.

### Source of the *ttd* Value

While it seems to be natural that a device itself indicates when it is ready to receive a command, it may not always be
possible or desirable to do so.
A device could e.g. be not capable to specify the value for *ttd* in it's message, or all devices of a particular setup
would always use the same value for *ttd*, so it would not make much sense to provide this value always again.
Additionally different protocols may or may not let a sender set specific values for a message, so a device using a 
specific protocol may not be able to provide a value for the *ttd* property at all.
For these reasons there are (resp. may be) additional ways of setting the value of *ttd*:

- Hono's Tenant and Device Registration APIs support the inclusion of default values for application-properties in the
  AMQP 1.0 message. By these means a device can be configured to always have a specific value for *ttd*.
- In a future extension there may be a configuration value per tenant and protocol adapter that sets the value of *ttd*
  if it was not provided by other means already (like provided to the protocol adapter or by setting a default value).
  
### Hono's HTTP protocol adapter

Hono's HTTP protocol adapter supports the setting of the *ttd* value in requests explicitly - please refer to the
[HTTP Adapter]({{< relref "/user-guide/http-adapter.md" >}}) for details.
Alternatively the default property values for devices from the Device Registry can be used (described above).
  
### Hono's MQTT protocol adapter

The MQTT protocol adapter automatically sends a *Time until disconnect notification* with a *ttd* value of `-1`
for a device that subscribes to the appropriate command topic (refer to the [MQTT Adapter user guide]
({{< relref "/user-guide/mqtt-adapter.md" >}}) for details).

When a device unsubscribes again, the adapter automatically sends a *Time until disconnect notification* with a *ttd* value of `0`.
