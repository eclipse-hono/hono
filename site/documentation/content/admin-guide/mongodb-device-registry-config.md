+++

The MongoDB based Device Registry component provides an implementation of Eclipse Hono&trade;'s [Device Registration]({{< relref "/api/device-registration" >}}),
[Credentials]({{< relref "/api/credentials" >}}) and [Tenant]({{< relref "/api/tenant" >}}) APIs. Protocol adapters use these APIs to determine a device's registration status, e.g. if it is enabled and if it is registered with a particular tenant, and to authenticate a device before accepting any data for processing from it. In addition to the above, this Device Registry also provides an implementation of [Device Registry Management APIs]({{< relref "/api/management" >}}) for managing tenants, registration information and credentials of devices.

The Device Registry is implemented as a Spring Boot application, and the data is persisted in a MongoDB database. It can be run either directly from the command line or by means of starting the corresponding [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/hono-service-device-registry-mongodb/) created from it.

## Service Configuration

The following table provides an overview of the configuration variables and corresponding command line options for configuring the MongoDB based Device Registry. In addition to the following options, this component also supports the options described in [Common Configuration]({{< relref "common-config.md" >}}).

| Environment Variable<br>Command Line Option | Mandatory | Default | Description                                                             |

The variables only need to be set if the default value does not match your environment.

## Port Configuration

The Device Registry supports configuration of both, an AMQP based endpoint as well as an HTTP based endpoint proving RESTful resources for managing registration information and credentials. Both endpoints can be configured to listen for connections on

* a secure port only (default) or
* an insecure port only or
* both a secure and an insecure port (dual port configuration)

See [Port Configuration]({{< relref "file-based-device-registry-config#port-configuration" >}}) for more information. 

{{% note %}}
The environment variables to use for configuring the REST endpoint are the same as the ones for the AMQP endpoint, substituting `_AMQP_` with `_HTTP_`.
