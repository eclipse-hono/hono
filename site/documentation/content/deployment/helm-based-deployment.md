Eclipse Hono&trade;'s components are provided as container images which can be run on arbitrary container orchestration
platforms. The [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh) can be used to install Hono to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
cluster by means of the *chart* maintained in the
[Eclipse IoT Packages&trade; chart repository](https://www.eclipse.org/packages/repository/).

Please refer to the [chart's README](https://github.com/eclipse/packages/blob/master/charts/hono/README.md) for
instructions regarding installation and configuration.
