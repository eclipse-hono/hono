   title: Eclipse Hono™ Device Registry API
   description: |
      This API defines how to manage *Tenants*, *Devices*, and *Credentials*.
      It acts as a common basis which all Hono device registries should
      implement.

      ## Required APIs

      All operations, except the `tenants` resource are required. The tenant
      management might be outside of the scope of the device registry and
      managed by a higher level system. In this case all calls should simply
      return `404`. However, if the `tenants` resource is implemented, then all
      operations of it must be implemented.

      ## Security

      This specification explicitly leaves out the part of authenticating and
      authorizing users with the device registry. It is assumed that some form
      of token exchange between the user agent and the backend service will
      take place. Like for example HTTP basic authentication, or a bearer token.

      ## Code generation

      This model is not optimized for generating code from it. Code generators
      try to understand the model and then translate this into the required
      programming language. Even if there would be no bugs in the code
      generators, that process would already only be an approximation. So
      this model focuses on the description of the API, and does not tweak
      the specification in a way to please code generators.

                  The subject DN of the trusted root certificate in
                  the format defined by RFC 2253.
                  CAs of the *same* tenant may share the same subject DN, for example
                  allowing for the definition of overlapping validity periods.
                  However, CAs of *different* tenants must not share the same
                  subject DN in order to allow for the unique look up of a tenant by
                  the subject DN of one of its trusted CAs.
                  If the `cert` property is used to provide an X.509 certificate
                  then the subject DN is determined from the certificate and this
                  property is ignored.
                  Otherwise, if the `public-key` property is
                  used, this property is mandatory.

                  If the `cert` property is used to provide an
                  X.509 certificate then the public key is extracted
                  from the certificate and this property is ignored.
                  Either this property or `cert` must be set.
            "algorithm":
               type: string
               description: |
                  The algorithm used for the public key of the CA.
                  If the `cert` property is used to provide an
                  X.509 certificate then the algorithm is determined
                  from the certificate and this property is ignored.
                  Otherwise, if the `public-key` property is
                  used, this property must be set to the algorithm
                  used, if other than the default.

                  may be used for authenticating devices.
                  If the `cert` property is used to provide an
                  X.509 certificate then the point in time is
                  determined from the certificate and this property is ignored.
                  Otherwise, if the `public-key` property is

                  The point in time until which the certificate authority
                  may be used for authenticating devices.
                  If the `cert` property is used to provide an
                  X.509 certificate then the point in time is
                  determined from the certificate and this property is ignored.

                  The Base64 encoded binary DER encoding of the trusted X.509 root certificate.
                  This property can be used as a convenient alternative to
                  specifying the `public-key`, `not-before`, `not-after` and
                  `algorithm` properties explicitly. Implementors of this
                  API may choose to support this property only for uploading
                  a certificate but then extract all relevant data and store
                  it in the properties described above.
                  Either this property or `public-key` must be set.

                  If it is *true* and the feature is supported by the device registry, the device registry
                  automatically provisions unregistered devices that authenticate with a client certificate

                  A value of `-1` (the default) indicates that no limit is set.
                  Note that this property contains the TTL in seconds whereas
                  the AMQP 1.0 specification defines a message's ttl header
