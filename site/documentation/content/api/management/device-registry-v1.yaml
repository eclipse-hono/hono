   title: Eclipse Hono™ Device Registry API
   description: |
      This API defines how to manage *Tenants*, *Devices*, and *Credentials*.
      It acts as a common basis which all Hono device registries should
      implement.

      ## Required APIs

      All operations, except the `tenants` resource are required. The tenant
      management might be outside of the scope of the device registry and
      managed by a higher level system. In this case all calls should simply
      return `404`. However, if the `tenants` resource is implemented, then all
      operations of it must be implemented.

      ## Security

      This specification explicitly leaves out the part of authenticating and
      authorizing users with the device registry. It is assumed that some form
      of token exchange between the user agent and the backend service will
      take place. Like for example HTTP basic authentication, or a bearer token.

      ## Code generation

      This model is not optimized for generating code from it. Code generators
      try to understand the model and then translate this into the required
      programming language. Even if there would be no bugs in the code
      generators, that process would already only be an approximation. So
      this model focuses on the description of the API, and does not tweak
      the specification in a way to please code generators.

            Clients use this operation to retrieve the set of credentials registered for an existing device.
            Hono's protocol adapters use the credentials registered for a device in order to
            authenticate the device when it connects to an adapter.
            Implementors may return all of the credentials' data including all
            details of its secrets like password hash and/or hash algortihm used.
            This mode of operation is called *replace mode*. However, this behavior is
            discouraged because it might disclose confidential information in plain text.

            Instead, implementors should remove all confidential information from the secrets
            and include a (unique) identifier with each secret. Clients can then refer to
            this identifier in order to update particular secrets. This mode of operation
            is called *patch mode*.

         summary: Updates a device's credentials.
         description: |
            A client uses this operation to update a device's existing set of credentials
            with the credentials contained in the request body.

            A registry may run in one of two modes for updating credentials, *replace mode*
            or *patch mode*. A client can determine the mode of operation by means of inspecting
            any of the secrets returned by the *getAllCredentials* operation. If the secrets
            do not contain an `id` property, then the registry uses *replace mode*, otherwise
            it operates in *patch mode*.

            In replace mode the registry simply replaces a device's existing set of credentials
            with the credentials provided in the request body.

            In patch mode the registry processes the set of updated credentials provided in the
            request body as follows.
            1. Start with an empty set `N` of new credentials.
            1. For each updated credentials object `c-U` contained in the request body,
               the registry looks up an existing credentials object `c-E` of the same device ID, type
               and authentication identifier.
               1. If no matching credentials object exists, `c-U` is added to the set of new
                  credentials `N`.
               1. Otherwise, `c-E` is patched over with `c-U` as follows. For each of `c-U`'s
                  secrets `s-U` the registry does the following
                  1. If `s-U` has no `id` property, the registry assigns a unique identifier to `s-U`.
                  1. Otherwise, the registry tries to find a secret `s-E` with the same identifier as `s-U`
                     among the secrets of `c-E`.
                     1. If no matching secret exists, updating the credentials has failed and the registry
                        returns a response with status 400 (Bad Request).
                     1. Otherwise the confidential properties of `s-E` are merged into `s-U`
                        with the property values of `s-U` taking precedence.
               1. `c-U` is added to `N`.
            1. The registry replaces the device's existing set of credentials with `N` and returns an
               empty response with status code 204 (No Content) to indicate the successful outcome of the
               operation.

               Note that `N` does not contain any of the existing credentials objects `c-E` for which
               no corresponding credentials object `c-U` with the same device ID, type and authentication
               identifier exists. This way, existing credentials can be deleted.
