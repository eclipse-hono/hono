   title: Eclipse Hono™ Device Registry API
   description: |
      This API defines how to manage *Tenants*, *Devices*, and *Credentials*.
      It acts as a common basis which all Hono device registries should
      implement.

      ## Required APIs

      All operations, except the `tenants` resource are required. The tenant
      management might be outside of the scope of the device registry and
      managed by a higher level system. In this case all calls should simply
      return `404`. However, if the `tenants` resource is implemented, then all
      operations of it must be implemented.

      ## Security

      This specification explicitly leaves out the part of authenticating and
      authorizing users with the device registry. It is assumed that some form
      of token exchange between the user agent and the backend service will
      take place. Like for example HTTP basic authentication, or a bearer token.

      ## Code generation

      This model is not optimized for generating code from it. Code generators
      try to understand the model and then translate this into the require
      programming language. Even if the there would be no bugs in the code
      generators, that process would be already only be an approximation. So
      this model does focus in the description of the API, and doesn't tweak
      the specification in a way to please code generators.
