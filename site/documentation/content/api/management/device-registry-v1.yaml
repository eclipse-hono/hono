   title: Eclipse Hono™ Device Registry API
   description: |
      This API defines how to manage *Tenants*, *Devices*, and *Credentials*.
      It acts as a common basis which all Hono device registries should
      implement.

      ## Required APIs

      All operations, except the `tenants` resource are required. The tenant
      management might be outside of the scope of the device registry and
      managed by a higher level system. In this case all calls should simply
      return `404`. However, if the `tenants` resource is implemented, then all
      operations of it must be implemented.

      ## Security

      This specification explicitly leaves out the part of authenticating and
      authorizing users with the device registry. It is assumed that some form
      of token exchange between the user agent and the backend service will
      take place. Like for example HTTP basic authentication, or a bearer token.

      ## Code generation

      This model is not optimized for generating code from it. Code generators
      try to understand the model and then translate this into the require
      programming language. Even if the there would be no bugs in the code
      generators, that process would be already only be an approximation. So
      this model does focus in the description of the API, and doesn't tweak
      the specification in a way to please code generators.

                  However, CAs of *different* tenants must not share the same
                  subject DN in order to allow for the unique look up of a tenant by
                  the subject DN of one of its trusted CAs.
                  If the `cert` property is used to provide an X.509 certificate
                  then the subject DN is determined from the certificate and this

                  X.509 certificate then the algorithm is determined
                  from the certificate and this property is ignored.
                  Otherwise, i.e. if the `public-key` property is

                  This property can be used as a convenient alternative to
                  specifying the `public-key`, `not-before`, `not-after` and
                  `algorithm` properties explicitly. Implementors of this
                  API may choose to support this property only for uploading
                  a certificate but then extract all relevant data and store
                  it in the properties described above.
                  Either this property or `public-key` must be set.
