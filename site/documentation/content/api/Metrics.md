Eclipse Hono&trade;'s components report several metrics which may be used to gain some insight
into the running system. For instance, the HTTP adapter reports the number of successfully
processed telemetry messages. Some of these metrics are considered part of Hono's external
interface. This section describes the semantics and format of the metrics, how they can be retrieved
and how to interpret actual values.

## Reported Metrics

Hono uses [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) for collecting metrics. Those metrics can be exported to different
back ends. Please refer to [Configuring Metrics]({{< relref "/admin-guide/monitoring-tracing-config#configuring-a-metrics-back-end" >}})
for details.

The container images published on Docker Hub have been compiled with support for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
as the metrics back end.

When deploying to Kubernetes/OpenShift, the metrics reported by Hono may contain
environment specific tags (like the *pod* name) which are added by the Prometheus
scraper. However, those tags are not part of the Hono metrics definition.

Hono applications may report other metrics in addition to the ones defined here.
In particular, all components report metrics regarding the JVM's internal state, e.g.
memory consumption and garbage collection status. Those metrics are not considered
part of Hono's *official* metrics definition. However, all those metrics
will still contain the common tags described below.

### Common Metrics

Tags for common metrics are:

| Tag              | Value              | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| *host*           | *string*           | The name of the host that the component reporting the metric is running on |
| *component-type* | `adapter`, `service` | The type of component reporting the metric |
| *component-name* | *string*           | The name of the component reporting the metric. |

The names of Hono's standard components are as follows:

The specific value depends on the TLS implementation used by the protocol adapter.<br/>The value `UNKNOWN` is used if the connection does not use TLS or the cipher suite could not be determined, e.g. because the connection attempt failed before the cipher suite has been negotiated. |

#### Minimum Message Size

If a minimum message size is configured for a [tenant]({{< relref "/api/tenant#tenant-information-format" >}}), 
then the payload size of the telemetry, event and command messages are calculated in accordance with the configured 
value and then reported to the metrics by the AMQP, HTTP and MQTT protocol adapters. If minimum message size is not 
configured for a tenant then the actual message payload size is reported.

Assume that the minimum message size for a tenant is configured as 4096 bytes (4KB). The payload size of 
an incoming message with size 1KB is calculated as 4KB by the protocol adapters and reported to the metrics system.
For an incoming message of size 10KB, it is reported as 12KB.

### Service Metrics

Hono's service components do not report any metrics at the moment.
