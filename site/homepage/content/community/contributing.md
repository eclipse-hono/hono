Here is a (non-exclusive, non-prioritized) list of things you might be able to help us with:

* bug reports
* bug fixes
* improvements regarding code quality e.g. improving readability, performance, modularity etc.
* documentation (Getting Started guide, Examples, Deployment instructions for cloud environments)
* features (both ideas and code are welcome)

You might also want to take a look at our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eclipse/hono/issues) page and see if you can help out with any of the issues listed. We have put a [help wanted](https://github.com/eclipse/hono/labels/help%20wanted) label on those issues that we are particularly keen on receiving contributions for.

## Conventions

1. The *groupId* of all Hono modules is `org.eclipse.hono`, *artifactId* always starts with `hono-`.
1. Modules producing a Docker image generally use `eclipse/${artifactId}` as the image's repository name.
1. All code complies with the formatting rules defined by the settings files in the `eclipse` folder.
1. Modules implementing one of the Hono APIs are sub-modules of `services`.

2. Create a new *feature branch* for your changes.
3. Make your changes.
4. Make sure your code complies with the formatting rules defined by the settings files in the `eclipse` folder.
5.  If you are creating new class files, make sure that they include a [proper copyright header](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-copyright-headers) at the top.
    Any new file created should contain a header based on the following template:

        /**

13. Push your changes to your branch in your forked repository.

## Submitting the Changes
