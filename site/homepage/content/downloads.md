## Binaries

Eclipse Hono's service components are provided by means of pre-built Docker images available from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipse/). These container images can be deployed to popular
container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift.

The release archive contains all files necessary to deploy Hono to a Kubernetes cluster using the
[Helm package manager](https://helm.sh).

* [Eclipse Hono 1.0.2 Helm Chart](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/eclipse-hono-1.0.2-chart.tar.gz)

Download and extract the archive and follow the [deployment guide]({{% doclink "/deployment/helm-based-deployment/" %}}).

A Java based command line client for consuming telemetry data and events from Hono is available for download as well:

* [Eclipse Hono 1.0.2 Command Line Client](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/hono-cli-1.0.2-exec.jar)

The client requires a Java 11 runtime environment to run.

Please refer to the [Admin Guide]({{% doclink "/admin-guide/hono-client-configuration/" %}}) for details regarding the command
line options that the client supports.

### Milestones

The newest features and bug fixes are available in *milestones* that are published every 4 -6 weeks.
Please note that these milestones represent the latest *state of development* which also means that APIs or features may
change from one milestone to the other. Milestones are mainly intended for testing purposes and should generally not
be used in a production environment.

Installation works the same way as for the latest stable release.
