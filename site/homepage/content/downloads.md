## Binaries

The preferred way of deploying Eclipse Hono&trade; is by means of using the pre-built Docker images provided
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/eclipse/).

The most convenient way to both pull the images and start corresponding containers is by means of running the deployment script contained in the release archive.

* [Eclipse Hono 0.9 Archive](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/eclipse-hono-deploy-0.9.tar.gz)

After downloading the archive, extract it to a local folder, change into that folder and run the following from the command line (assuming that your local Docker client is configured to connect to a Docker Swarm manager):

~~~sh
deploy/docker/swarm_deploy.sh
~~~

Hono supports deployment to the following container orchestration platforms:

* [Kubernetes](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/latest/deployment/helm-based-deployment/)
* [OpenShift](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/latest/deployment/openshift/)
* [Docker Swarm](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/latest/deployment/docker-swarm/)

A Java based command line client for consuming telemetry data and events from Hono is available for download as well:

* [Eclipse Hono 0.9 Command Line Client](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/hono/hono-cli-0.9-exec.jar)

The client requires a Java 11 runtime environment and can be run from the command line like this:

~~~sh
java -jar hono-cli-0.9-exec.jar --hono.client.host=hono.eclipse.org --hono.client.port=15671 \
--hono.client.tlsEnabled=true --hono.client.username=consumer@HONO --hono.client.password=verysecret \
--spring.profiles.active=receiver --tenant.id=DEFAULT_TENANT
~~~

Please refer to the [Admin Guide](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/latest/admin-guide/hono-client-configuration/) for details regarding the command line options that the client supports.
