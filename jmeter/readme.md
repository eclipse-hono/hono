This JMeter plugin provides a sender and receiver sampler for Eclipse Hono.

# Installation
 
 - Run `mvn clean install assembly:single` to build the needed jar with dependencies for JMeter
 - Install [JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
 - Copy the `target/hono-jmeter-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar` into the  `<jmeter-installation>/lib/ext` directory.
 - Start JMeter

# Provided testplan

To start you can load the test plan `src/jmeter/hono_jmeter_runtime.jmx` in JMeter. It provides a test plan, which runs receiver and sender sampler for a given time with a given amount of threads (devices/solution-receivers). It assumes the typical Hono "get started" docker installation. 

You may need to change some properties of the Hono Sender/Hono Receiver - e.g. the truststore path, ports etc.

# Important

 - If you want to use more than one thread for the receivers, you should configure the qpid router to `balanced` (vs. `multicast`).
 - Sender could be configured to wait for n active receivers (from this test plan and JMeter instance) - this could be used to make sure, that the receivers on the address (like `telemetry/DEFAULT_TENANT`) are started before sending begins.
