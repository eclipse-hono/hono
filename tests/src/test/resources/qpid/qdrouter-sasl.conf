# SASL Mechanisms and Users
#---------------------------------
#
# This default mech list allows for PLAIN, but that
# mechanism sends credentials in the clear, and is normally 
# only used along with SSL transport-layer security.
#
# This default also permits DIGEST-MD5, but you must have
# a user and password defined in your sasldb file to use
# this mechanism.    ( See notes below. )
#
#                              PLEASE NOTE 
#  For production messaging systems, a high-security mechanism such as
#  DIGEST-MD5 or PLAIN+SSL should be used.
#
#
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
sasldb_path: /etc/hono/qdrouterd.sasldb
mech_list: ANONYMOUS DIGEST-MD5 EXTERNAL PLAIN



#---------------------------------
# Please Note
#---------------------------------
#
# 1. If you use a nonstandard location for your sasl_config directory,
#    you can point qdrouterd to it by using the container->saslConfigPath
#    configuration attribute.
#
#    If your nonstandard sasl directory is $MY_SASL_DIR, put a copy
#    of this file at $MY_SASL_DIR/qdrouterd.conf, alter the mech list as 
#    appropriate for your installation, and then use the saslpasswd2 
#    command to add new user+passwd pairs:
#      echo $PASSWD | saslpasswd2 -c -p -f $MY_SASL_DIR/qdrouterd.sasldb -u QPID $USERNAME
#    
#
# 2. The standard location for the qdrouterd sasldb file is 
#       /var/lib/qdrouterd/qdrouterd.sasldb
#
# 3. You can see what usernames have been stored in the sasldb, with the
#    command "sasldblistusers2 -f /var/lib/qdrouterd/qdrouterd.sasldb"
#
# 4. The sasldb file must be readable by the user running the qdrouterd
#    daemon, ( the user name is qdrouterd ) and should be readable only 
#    by that user.
#
# 5. The EXTERNAL mechanism allows you to use SSL transport layer 
#    security.  In that case, you can also set the broker option
#    --ssl-require-client-authentication .
