/**
 * A component for determining where a incoming command message should be targeted at when processing the message in a
 * protocol adapter.
 * <p>
 * This refers to finding the <em>protocol adapter instance</em> that a device or gateway has connected to in order to
 * receive a command message. Furthermore, it is determined to which <em>gateway</em> a command is to be mapped to or
 * whether it will be sent to the target device directly.
 * <p>
 * Note that if multiple gateways are connected and able to handle the incoming command message, it is up to the
 * <em>CommandTargetMapper</em> implementation to choose just one.
 * <p>
 * The <em>CommandTargetMapper</em> will return a gateway id as target, if there is no command consumer registered
 * specifically for the device id of the command, but instead there is a consumer registered for a gateway that may act
 * on behalf of the device.
 * <p>
 * Note that this also means that if a <em>gateway</em> has registered itself as a command consumer for a <em>specific
 * device</em> (instead of as a consumer for commands to <em>any</em> device that the gateway may handle), that gateway
 * won't be returned here for that device. That kind of gateway mapping will occur when processing the command at the
 * target protocol adapter instance.
