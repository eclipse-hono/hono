 * Interface that all credentials validators need to implement.

 * Any mechanism to authenticate a device is based on credentials secrets that are defined in the
 * <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/hono/api/Credentials-API/">Credentials API</a>.
 * This interface defines the methods necessary to provide an algorithm for validating any of these secrets.
 * <p>
 * Validators that implement this interface and are implemented as Spring beans in the package
 * {@link org.eclipse.hono.service.credentials.validators} will be automatically found during startup and are used
 * during authentication.
 * This makes adding of own validators very easy.
 * <p>See the provided validators (e.g. {@link org.eclipse.hono.service.credentials.validators.HashedPasswordValidator})
 * as a blueprint for how to write own validators.
 * See {@link AbstractSecretValidator} as the base class for such
 * implementations.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of secret that is validated: this can be String in case of password validation, a certificate
 *           class in case of a client certificate, etc.
